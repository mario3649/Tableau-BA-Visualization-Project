- The Boeing 747-400 is the highest overall rated aircraft by a wide margin. Directly followed by its sister model the Boeing 747.
### Cabin Staff Service:
- Cabin Staff Service has been consistenly positive in the dataset. There is a clear standard and minimal deveation.
### Entertainment: 
- Entertainment is a clear weak point for British Airways with the average rating being only 1.4 out of 5. Seats in business class actually even see a downtick in rating at 1.3. First Class seats do provide an improvement in rating at 2.7, however that is still far off from quality.
### Ground Service:
- During the last year recorded, October 2022 - October 2023 the average ground service has decreased just over a point at a steady rate. The A320 and A321 specifically have the lowest ratings by aircraft.
### Seat Comfort:
- Year over Year, seat comfort has a had a slight 3% decrease in rating however it is not enough to be statistically significant. The Boeing 787 has been the most comfortable airplane the past two years.
### Value: 
- May 2021 had the highest value rating within our recorded range at 4.0. On the contrary, May the year prior in 2020 had the lowest recorded at 1.0.

## Recommendations:
- **Enhance Overall Experience:** The significant decline in the overall rating (from 6.1 in March 2016 to 2.3 in October 2023) indicates a need for a comprehensive review of services. Customer satisfaction strategies should be evaluated and improved to reverse this trend. The Boeing 747-400 has consistently received the highest ratings. Consider replicating the features and services that contribute to its success across other aircraft models to boost overall ratings.
- **Maintain and Leverage Strong Cabin Staff Service:** With cabin staff service consistently receiving positive ratings, British Airways should maintain current training standards and service protocols. Additionally, leveraging this strength in marketing and customer communications could help bolster overall customer satisfaction.
- **Invest in Entertainment Upgrades:** The consistently low entertainment ratings (averaging 1.4 out of 5) reveal a major area for improvement. Upgrading in-flight entertainment systems and content, especially in business and first-class cabins, should be prioritized. The business class, in particular, sees a surprising dip, which could impact premium customers.
- **Focus on Value Perception:** The fluctuations in value ratings, with a peak in May 2021 (4.0) and a low in May 2020 (1.0), suggest that value perception is highly sensitive to service quality and external factors. Analyzing the reasons behind these fluctuations can help British Airways stabilize and improve value ratings.
